# Scripted VS Declarative

The primary difference between scripted and declarative pipelines in Jenkins lies in their syntax and overall structure. Both pipeline types are used for defining continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows as code, but they have distinct characteristics:

## Scripted Pipeline:

* Syntax and Flexibility: Scripted pipelines use Groovy scripting syntax. This provides a high degree of flexibility and allows you to write complex logic, loops, conditionals, and custom methods within your pipeline. It's well-suited for advanced users who need fine-grained control over their pipeline flow and execution.

* Procedural Style: Scripted pipelines follow a more procedural programming style. You write a series of steps in a linear fashion, defining exactly what should happen at each step.

* Less Opinionated: Scripted pipelines allow you to define and manage stages, steps, and execution flow in a way that best suits your requirements. However, this flexibility can sometimes lead to less consistency in pipeline definitions.

## Declarative Pipeline:

* Declarative Syntax: Declarative pipelines use a more structured and human-readable syntax. It's designed to be simpler and more approachable, especially for those new to Jenkins or CI/CD.

* Opinionated Structure: Declarative pipelines follow a predefined structure and enforce a specific set of steps, which makes the pipeline code easier to read, write, and maintain. It's well-suited for standard CI/CD patterns.

* Limited Flexibility: While declarative pipelines cover most common use cases, they might not offer the same level of flexibility as scripted pipelines when dealing with complex or non-standard scenarios.

* Guided Configuration: Declarative pipelines guide you to define certain sections like stages, steps, and post-build actions in a consistent way, promoting best practices and making the pipeline structure more uniform across projects.

In summary, scripted pipelines provide more advanced scripting capabilities and customization options, making them suitable for complex or non-standard workflows. Declarative pipelines, on the other hand, offer a more structured and opinionated approach that's ideal for standard CI/CD scenarios and for those who prefer a simpler and more guided syntax. 

The choice between scripted and declarative pipelines depends on your project's requirements, your familiarity with Groovy scripting, and the level of control you need over your pipeline logic.
